## Website Description
### Purpose 
This website was created for two primary reasons:  

1. To complete the T1A2 Portfolio assignment for the Coder Academy Bootcamp.
2. To act as a platform to demonstrate my developing coding skills, and understanding of different coding languages.  

### Functionality 
The website was designed to be simplistic and easy to read with a pastel colour palette. 

Responsiveness was also implemented, allowing viewers to read it on a variety of devices.  
###  Features
The main features of the website include animations - This was in an attempt to show website fluidity and design skill that attracts any prospective employers.

### Sitemap 
![A Sitemap Sketch](./docs/sitemap.png)

    As the sitemap shows, the user starts on the fake search page - they are then
    prompted to search for a full stack developer which takes them to the about
    me page, which can access the other pages and vice versa. 

    The about me page also links to a PDF of my resume, and the contact details page
    links to my GitHub and the LinkedIn website (this links directly to the website
    as I do not have a LinkedIn.)

###  Target Audience
The target audience for this website is for prospective employers once I have received my qualifications.
### Tech Stack
This website features HTML and CSS coding.
